# VLearn
Immersive Approach To Awareness and Education.

# The problem V-Learn solves
Awareness and Education are two of the essential ingredients of developing belief. Awareness has been highlighted by many as a key indicator of success in a range of performance environments. It is arguably the most important ingredient for belief as every other skill, quality, and task you have and undertake can be traced back to awareness. Being aware will give you an insight into your beliefs and whether they are positive or holding you back. But it takes a lot more than information to make kids understand and follow things. While on the other hand education is important to shape an individual. I wanted to make something that helps create awareness, about the do's and don't s of Covid-19 among kids, alongside it being entertaining, immersive, and educational and as VR is the best immersive technology available out there and keeping in mind the tendency of kids to explore new things, this application has been developed.
